# Contributing to Kubernetes Best Practices

:+1::tada: First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute! :tada::+1:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Discussing the current state of the the guide
- Proposing new features
- Submitting a fix or a new feature/term
- Becoming a maintainer

## We Develop and growth with Github
We use github to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## We Use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html), So All Code Changes Happen Through Pull Requests
Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase (we use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html)). We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. Prefer write the commits using [Convetional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/)
3. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
4. If you've added a doc or example, make it understandable and clear
5. Ensure the test suite passes.
6. Make sure your code lints.
7. Issue that pull request!

## Any contributions you make will be under the Apache Software License
In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [Apache 2.0 January 2004](https://github.com/Malagurti/kubernetes-best-practices/blob/main/LICENSE/) that covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.

## Report bugs using Github's [issues](https://github.com/diegolnasc/kubernetes-best-practices/issues)
We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/diegolnasc/kubernetes-best-practices/issues/new); it's that easy!

## Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code
[This is an example](https://github.com/stevemao/github-issue-templates/blob/master/bugs-only/ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md) of a bug report.

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can.
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

People *love* thorough bug reports. I'm not even kidding.

## Use a Consistent Coding Style

Choose the standart coding style based on the language, framework or file, that you will submit
